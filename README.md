## Hi there 👋

Call me Jessie.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building a repo of samples of my Power BI projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Git, GitHub and BitBucket.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with best practices for a team to use BitBucket for dev changes with Power BI reports.
- 💬 Ask me about Power BI administration and managed self-service architecture.
